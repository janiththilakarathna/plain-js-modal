This is inspired from [Victor Eke](https://github.com/evavic44)'s article in [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). Article is available [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-modal-with-javascript/). This code can be run independent of other projects, unlike in the original project.
